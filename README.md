* ### **Fiverr : End-to-End Project includes Deployment** 

**Problem statement -**
Recently attackers are using freelance job sites such as Fiverr to distribute malware disguised as job offers. These job offers contain attachments that pretend to be the job brief but are actually installers for keyloggers such as Agent Tesla or Remote Access Trojan (RATs). Due to this many users lost their earnings, bidding fees and fake client projects, also some users lost their accounts too. Many of my LinkedIn connections faced it and some of them lost their professional growth, side income and stability.

Just after a month of this attack Fiverr come-up with a Kaggle competition on this to understand how data science people will solve this problem by using their differ methods and techniques.

*Objective : - Find a good fit algorithm which will have Potential to Predict Spammers.*

* Note : Also, I will try to deploy my ml model to show that which User ID is spammer or not

* ### **Audit Risk : ML will help !!!**  

**Problem Statement and about dataset :-**
The goal of the dataset is to help the auditors by building a classification model that can predict the fraudulent firm on the basis the present and historical risk factors.

The information about the sectors and the counts of firms are listed respectively as

Irrigation (114), Public Health (77), Buildings and Roads (82), Forest (70), Corporate (47), Animal Husbandry (95), Communication (1), Electrical (4), Land (5), Science and Technology (3), Tourism (1), Fisheries (41), Industries (37), Agriculture (200).

This research work is a case study of an external government audit company which is also the external auditor of government firms of India. During audit-planning, auditors examine the business of different government offices but the target to visit the offices with very-high likelihood and significance of misstatements. This is calculated by assessing the risk relevant to the financial reporting goals (Houston, Peters, and Pratt 1999). The three main objective of the study are as follow:

* To understand the audit risk analysis work-flow of the company by in-depth interview with the audit employees, and to propose a decision-making framework for risk assessment of firms during audit planning.

* To examine the present and historical risk factors for determining the Risk Audit Score for 777 target firms, to implement the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm to rank examined risk factors, and evaluating the Risk Audit Class (Fraud and No-Fraud) of nominated firms.

* To examine the present and historical risk factors for determining the Risk Audit Score for 777 target firms, to implement the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm to rank examined risk factors, and evaluating the Risk Audit Class (Fraud and No-Fraud) of nominated firms.
